I am currently an instructor at the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. Prior to that, I received my PhD at Caltech in 2021 under the supervision of [Dinakar Ramakrishnan](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dinakar/).

I can be reached at liyangy@princeton.edu. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6QWHOefWmmFnDT0fnTJKxl-M-_6u03i/view?usp=sharing).



## Research Interest
My research interests primarily revolve around number theory, automorphic forms, harmonic analysis, representations of Lie and $p$-adic groups
