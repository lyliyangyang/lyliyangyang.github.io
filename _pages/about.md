I am an instructor at the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University, where I am actively involved in teaching and conducting research. 

## Research Interest
My research interests primarily revolve around Number Theory, Representation Theory, Harmonic Analysis, and the Langlands Program. One of my main research interest is relative trace formula 

## Preprints and Publications
* Relative Trace Formula and L-functions for GL(n+1)$$\times$$ GL(n) \[[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02225.pdf)\]


* Relative Trace Formula and twisted L-functions: the Burgess Bound \[[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10719.pdf)\]
