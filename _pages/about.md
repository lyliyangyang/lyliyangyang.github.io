I am an instructor at the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University, where I am actively involved in teaching and conducting research. 

## Research Interest
My research interests primarily revolve around Number Theory, Representation Theory, Harmonic Analysis, and the Langlands Program. One of my main research interest is relative trace formula
